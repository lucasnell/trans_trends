abstract = {In nature, multiple parasite species infect multiple host species and are influenced by processes operating across different spatial and temporal scales. Data sets incorporating these complexities offer exciting opportunities to examine factors that shape epidemics. We present a method using generalized linear mixed models in a multilevel modeling framework to analyze patterns of variances and correlations in binomially distributed prevalence data. We then apply it to a multi-lake, multiyear data set involving two Daphnia ...},

Here, we present a method for estimating the average vital rates that parameterize a demographic matrix using a series of measurements of population size and structure (an ``inverse problem'' of demographic analysis). We join a deterministic, density-independent demographic matrix model with a stochastic observation model to write a likelihood function for the matrix parameters given the data.

abstract = {Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these data also provide information about the vital rates (eg, birth rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions ...},

abstract = {Leslie matrix models are an important analysis tool in conservation biology that are applied to a diversity of taxa. The standard approach estimates the finite rate of population growth (?) from a set of vital rates. In some instances, an estimate of ? is available, but the vital rates are poorly understood and can be solved for using an inverse matrix approach. However, these approaches are rarely attempted due to prerequisites of information on the structure of age or stage classes. This study addressed this issue by using a combination of Monte Carlo ...},
